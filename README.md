## Introduction  
ConfigX is a powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use settings manager built around the concept of **keypaths**.  
A **keypath** is a dot-separated string representing the hierarchy of keys in a dictionary, enabling quick access and modifications.  

### What is a Keypath?  
Imagine your settings file is like a box inside a box inside *another* box:  

```python
data = {'fridge': {'shelf': {'item': 'cake', 'quantity': 1}, 'temperature': -2}}
```  

Now, instead of fumbling through boxes like:  
**"Where's that cake again?"**  

You simply use a *keypath*, like a magical treasure map:  
```python
keypath = 'fridge.shelf.item'
```  
**Result?** You instantly find your `'cake'` üç∞ without breaking a sweat.

Or change things up:  
```python
keypath = 'fridge.temperature=-5'
```  
**Boom!** The fridge is now colder ‚ùÑÔ∏è and your ice cream stays frosty.  

### Why ConfigX?

ConfigX is designed for **huge settings files** or **structured key-value data** in formats like JSON, YAML, or similar. Whether you're building an app with an overwhelming number of settings or managing complex nested data, ConfigX makes it **quick and easy** to access, modify, and organize your settings.

- **No more digging through massive files**: Simply reference settings with a **keypath** like a GPS for your data.
- **Save time**: Stop dealing with repetitive code to access deeply nested data. ConfigX does it for you with blazing speed.

ocs.resolve('app.ui.theme=light')  # Output: 'light'

# Set user language preference
ocs.resolve('user.language=en')  # Output: 'en'
